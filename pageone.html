<h2 style= background-color:aquamarine>...I'm Charle</h2>
<p>I am new to learning to code but I am also a passionate learner.  What I am intresed in doing as an everyday job is designing UI. </p>
<p>I enjoy things both technical and artistic and so I feel this is an excellent combination of the two genres. While I have many hobbies like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Crochet</li>
    <li>Watercolor</li>
    <li>Artistic Dance</li>
    <li>Sculpting</li>
    <li>etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>The other half of me cannot resist things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Math on Khan Acadmy</li>
    <li>Readint How To Books</li>
    <li>Trying to figure out the mechanics of how things work</li>
    <li>Space Science</li>
    <li>Learning to Code</li>
</ul>
<p>While studying a lot can sometimes be a bear...
